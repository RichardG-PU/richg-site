    About Me

  <div class="text-zinc-400 font-mono mt-4">
    <p>
      I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Montreal
      (UdeM), with an expected graduation date in 2027 (BSc). Alongside my
      studies, I balance part-time work and a variety of personal interests,
      including:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
      <li>Coding and exploring web frameworks like React.</li>
      <li>Working primarily in Linux environments and experimenting with tools
        like Vim.</li>
      <li>Using tools such as LaTeX and Notion for writing and organization.</li>
      <li>Engaging in mathematical problem-solving.</li>
      <li>Maintaining physical training as a consistent routine.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      I tend to rotate between systems-level tools, abstract concepts, and
      practical projects, treating problem-solving as a process of exploration
      rather than a fixed workflow.
